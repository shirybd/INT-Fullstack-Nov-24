// 6. I have time for a full guess my number project!
//     * Add a main menu where the user can start a new game, change the settings, or quit
//     * After each play, return to the main menu
//     * If the user clicks "cancel" in the prompt, allow the user to give up (ask if the user wants to give up)
//     * Settings to modify:
//         * Difficulty - change the range the selected number can be chosen from (higher difficulty === wider range)
//         * Number of gueeses
//         * Play mode - classic (above/bellow) or hot/cold (remember the previous guess and say hot/cold if the current guess is closer/further from the secret number respectively)
//     * Validate all the inputs
