1. Read string from the user until the user hits cancel. Ask the user for a number (N). Alert the Nth string
2. Read 10 numbers. Alert all the numbers in ascending order (one alert or multiple) (don't use array methods)
3. Read a number (N). Read N numbers. Print the median (if N is odd then (N + 1)/2 else the average of N/2 and N/2 + 1)
4. Create a function that accepts an array of number and returns the 2 smallest numbers
5. Create a grade recording system
    - the user should be able to record new grades
    - the user should be able to see all the existing grades (single alert)
    - the user should be able to remove grades
    - the user should be able to get stats (min, max, avg, mid)
    - the user should be able to quit the program
6. Bonus! do 5, but for each grade also record the class
